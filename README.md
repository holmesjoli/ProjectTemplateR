# Project Template R

Project template R creates a base file and package structure that I tend to use with every single R package that I write. 
Projec template R automates all of these steps into one simple line.

## Create new project

1.  Open a terminal which can read Rscript calls
2.  Navigate to the folder where R packages are stored
3.  Clone the [ProjectTemplateR](https://github.com/holmesjoli/ProjectTemplateR) package 
4.  Run the following line the terminal, replacing `ProjName` with the name of your project

```r
Rscript ProjectTemplateR/R/main.R -p "ProjName"
```
